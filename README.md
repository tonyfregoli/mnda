NHS Strategic Clinical Networks Ranking
=======================================
_Formerly known as D3 Crosstab_

The table at the bottom includes the results of a survey of people with MND about the time taken from the first GP consultation until the referral to a neurologist. The bar chart in the middle displays the same percentages graphically.

Data is broken down by _NHS Strategic Clinical Network_ and the map shows the _network_ boundaries.

How would rate the performance of each Clinical Network?

**Mark each waiting time to your own judgement here below, then click on Update to rank the networks accordingly and display their performance on the map.**

For example: _Less than one month_ is good, then I'll give it a 10, _Between 1-3 months_ is less good, I'll give it a 5, etc... suggested values: 10, 5, 1, -3, -6, -10, 0.
